# sumo-bot-challenge-2015
Code for a sumo bot that I worked on with two others.

The sumo competition, held last year by UTRA (University of Toronto Robotics Association) is a competition for beginner robot builders.

It involves 2 bots on a black disk with white borders.

The point of the competition is to push the opponent off the disk, with no human intervention (all the robots are autonomous). The white borders are there to help the bots know whether they are on the edge of the disk or not.

The game ends when a bot is pushed off, or a bot goes off the edge by mistake.

Video for reference (that's not our bot!):

The competition was great, and my team & I won third place.
